    "Berdasarkan hasil evaluasi, dapat disimpulkan bahwa model rekomendasi yang digunakan saat ini masih belum optimal. Skor precision yang rendah menunjukkan bahwa sebagian besar kursus yang direkomendasikan tidak sesuai dengan kebutuhan pengguna, sementara skor recall yang belum maksimal mengindikasikan bahwa banyak kursus relevan yang belum berhasil dikenali oleh sistem. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa representasi vektor dari teks atau strategi pemeringkatan masih perlu ditingkatkan agar model mampu menangkap makna permintaan pengguna secara lebih akurat."
